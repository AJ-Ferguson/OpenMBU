MarbleBlast is the first game developed internally by GarageGames and uses the <font:Arial Bold:16>Torque Shader Engine<font:Arial:16>.  MarbleBlast is a marble based action/arcade game with dozens of challenging levels with moving platforms, hazards and power ups.  GarageGames created MarbleBlast in just under 6 months with only minor modifications to the <font:Arial Bold:16>Torque Shader Engine<font:Arial:16>.  The most notable changes were the addition of smooth shading to interior objects and custom marble physics.
